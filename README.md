# emfpermanentmagnetsolenoidcoil
This repository contains about simulation an electromotive force of a cylindrical permanent magnet undergo a vertically-damped oscillation inside a solenoid coil that is attached to an oscilloscope. 
This simulation is used to introduce high school student about the concept of electromagnetic induction and the basic of generating electricity from mechanical motion of a magnets.
